## Self Hosting

New self hosting instructions coming soon!

### Hosting

With the application configured, you can now host your frontend however you prefer.
An easy option is [vercel](https://vercel.com). Once you've chosen your hosting
option, you will need to add it as a platform in you appwrite project. From your
project dashboard, under "Integrations" select "Add Platform" and enter the URL
where your frontend is hosted (eg. your-app.vercel.app or *.yourwebsite.com).
The wildcard is useful if you're using a custom domain and use multiple subdomains.

### You're done!

You should now be self hosting SimpliFeed! This guide is a work in progress, so if
you hit any snags in the process feel free to create an issue here in GitHub.
